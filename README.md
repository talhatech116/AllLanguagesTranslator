## 📚 Case Study: Empowering Global Communication

### 🧩 The Problem
Travelers, international students, and professionals often rely on multiple tools for language translation, leading to a fragmented experience. Many apps lacked support for speech or image input, and rarely included a reliable history system.  

There was **no single app** that could **seamlessly translate text, speech, and images** while preserving a record of past translations.  

### 💡 The Solution
We created **TranslateDSC** — an all-in-one translation companion.  

- Unified interface for text, speech, and image translation  
- Saved translation history with search and tagging  
- Built-in offline capabilities for seamless travel and communication  
- Designed for users who value both convenience and accuracy
